    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your Data:&lt;/strong&gt; When you use our Services, you provide us with things like your name, email, organization, information collected via the app and so on (“Your Data”). These Terms don’t give us any rights to Your Data except for the limited rights that enable us to offer the Services. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We need your permission to do things like hosting Your Data and backing it up. You give us permission to do those things, and this permission extends to trusted third parties we work with. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Note: Our services let you share Your Data with others, so please think carefully about what you share and with whom you choose to share. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paid Accounts: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Billing.&lt;/em&gt; You can add paid features to your account (“Paid Account”). We’ll bill you from the date you and Puente enter into an agreement in regards to your Paid Account and on each periodic renewal until cancelation or the contract expires. You’re responsible for all applicable taxes and we’ll charge tax when required to do so. Some countries have mandatory local laws regarding your cancellation rights, and this paragraph does not override these laws. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Refunds:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; You can cancel your Puente Account at any time. Refunds are only issued if required by law or stated refund policy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Downgrades: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Your Paid Account will remain in effect until it’s cancelled, terminated or expired under these Terms. If you don’t pay for your Paid Account on time, we reserve the right to suspend or reduce your storage to free space levels. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Changes: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;We may change the fees in effect but will give you advance notice of these changes via a message to the email address associated with your account. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Termination: &lt;/strong&gt;You’re free to stop using our Services at any time. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Services with notice to you if:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;you’re in breach of these Terms,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;you’re using the Services in a manner that would cause a real risk of harm or  loss to us or other users, or &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;you don’t have a paid account and haven’t accessed Puente’s Service for 6 consecutive months.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Well provide you with reasonable advance notice via the email address associated with your account to remedy the activity that prompted Puente to contact you and give you the opportunity to export Your Data from our Services. If after such notice you fail to take the steps we ask of you, we’ll terminate or suspend your access to the Services. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We won’t provide notice before termination where: &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;you’re in material breach of these Terms,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;doing so would cause us legal liability or compromise our ability to provide the Services to our other users, or&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;we’re prohibited from doing so by law. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compliance with Laws:&lt;/strong&gt; You agree to comply with all governmental laws, statutes, ordinances, and regulations regarding your Site/Services use. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indemnity:&lt;/strong&gt; You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Puente, its affiliates and their respective employees, contractors, agents, officers and directors from and against try and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs, debt or expenses (including without limitation attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to any claim, suit, action or proceeding by a third party arising out of or relating to your use of the Site and Services, breach of these Terms, violation of law, or any Content that you post, upload or cause to interface with the Site, or otherwise transfer, process, use or store in connection with the Site. &lt;/p&gt;
